[Collaide](https://collaide.com)
 Collaide is Web plateform for working more efficiently in groups. We
 implement a modern and convivial way of discussing, saving and sharing
 files with members of a group. Thus, the gestionary and creation of
 groups is easy with our clear and intuitive interface.

## Motivations
The need for creating this kind of plateform comes from the fact it do
not exists a free, open-source and **gratuit** tools for helping
the work in group. We are students and for each group project we
communicate through e-mail or Facebook and exchange files(reports,
presentations) through
Dropbox, e-mail, GoogleDoc and so on.

> And, what is the problem?

The problem is that e-mails discussions are not archived, are lost in
the amount of e-mails received each days and are not suitable for long
discussions with a lot fo replies. Discussing on Facebook is good for
short reply but discourage bigger and more in-depth discussions. There
is not **mise en forme**, no pagination, no regroupment by subject and
everything is on one page.

Exchanging files by e-mails is painful beacause we need to resend the
files at each modifications, the size of the file is limited and there
is no centralized reposiotory.

By using a plateform like Dropbox, Facebook, GoogleDoc, etc, we have a
limited control on our datas and we don't know in which way they will be
used. These **entreprises** and these servers are almost on the USA
which the consquence is that we have limited rights. And more, the way
they are working is opaque and we don't know what is going on. The risk
to lose control on our datas hosted by these services exists.

> And the solution?
